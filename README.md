# ðŸŒº flowerchat - A fully decentralized chat app

Flowerchat is a fully decentralized TUI chat application built upon
[libflowerpot](https://github.com/krypt0nn/libflowerpot), a blockchain framework
written in rust.

Flowerchat brings the concept of "spaces" - separate blockchains with individual
rules and content. Spaces can be created by anybody, and everybody can join them
by default. To perform any actions space members will have to prove that they
are not robots by solving PoW tasks and earning "balance". This is a necessary
step to reduce bot abuse in the network. With enough balance users can create
chats within the space, take nicknames, and send new messages. Administrators
of the space and each chat have moderation tools to ensure that their members
follow the local communication rules.
